# Simple-platform

Device for launching unmanned drones from moving platforms (eg car). 

The device was originally designed for launching of the unmanned [autogyro TF-G2](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TF-G2/). Thanks to the combination of the automatic starting platform and the automatic takeoff mode of the TF-G2 unmanned autogyro, it is possible to perform safe and almost unattended takeoff. Platform is controlled from GCS based on realtime data from the UAV. The platform can be disconnected manually (by man) due to service operations.
